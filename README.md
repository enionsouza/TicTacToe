# The TicTacToe Game

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English and British English), or Xs and Os/‚ÄúX‚Äôy O‚Äôsies‚Äù (Ireland), is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

# Development Milestones

- Milestone 1: Project setup was performed as described in the requirements.
- Milestone 2: We created the user interface on `bin/main.rb` file for the TicTacToe Game project.
- Milestone 3: We added the game logic in the file `lib/tic_tac_toe.rb`.
- Milestone 4: We added instructions for players to enable them to understand and play the game successfully.

- The app will reject an invalid number and require the player to enter another number from the remaining numbers.

- The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. However, if there are no remaining numbers to choose and no winner, then it's a tie (a draw game) also called *Cats Game* in TicTacToe.
